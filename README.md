A general C++-library for treating stoichiometries in multi-species transport problems.

The following things will be added soon:

* more comments
* doxygen support

A paper about this project has been submitted and will hopefully be accepted soon.
More information will follow.

Further versions of StoichPack will include:
* heterogeneous and homogeneous equilibrium reactions
* more detailed: algebraic conditions
