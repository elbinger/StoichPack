If you use Linux and have g++ installed: execute make
Otherwise: configure Makefile.inc, then execute make

Files:
The example in this folder uses Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for linear algebra. The Makefile will extract the source files.
The file StoichPackEigen demonstrates how to make StoichPack use the linear algebra functions of eigen.

The directory Utility contains some basic utilities: A mesh class, a sparse matrix class, a vector class for multi-species context and a Newton method. You should look at this directory first.

The directory MyBiochemicalSystems contains some example biochemical systems (not taken from real world) and function for loading those systems
and default initial values. You should look at this directory before looking at ODEExample and PDEExample.

The directory ODEExample contains an example on how to solve ODE systems with StoichPack and how to use preprocessing.

The directory PDEExample contains an example on how to solve PDE systems with StoichPack using Finite Differences and how to use preprocessing.
